Modular Markup Guide
=======

This modular markup guide was developed as a way to bring new front-end developers up to speed on LexisNexis Web Visibility Solutions products.

What you'll find:

* File Structure
* Modular Zones
* Naming Conventions
* Grid Framework
* CSS Style Guide, normalize.css, 
* JavaScript Frameworks, Plugins, etc.
* PHP Frameworks, Snippets of Code, Hooks, etc.

The Ebb & Flow page is a high level overview, and the Index is a sitemap. Some links go to our internal MediaWiki which will not work outside of our network.
